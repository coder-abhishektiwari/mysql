# SQL Editor - Python-Based SQL Command Line Interface

A Python-based SQL editor that allows users to interact with MySQL databases through a command-line interface. This program helps users perform various SQL operations such as creating databases, tables, inserting data, querying, and more—all via an interactive menu.

## Features

- **Login to MySQL server** using username and password
- **View existing databases** and select a database for operations
- **Perform database operations**: Create, Drop, and Use databases
- **Table management**: Create, Show, Drop tables, Insert, Update, and Delete records
- **Execute complex SQL queries** like conditional SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, and more
- **Custom SQL query execution** for dynamic queries
- **Error handling**: Prompts users when incorrect credentials are entered
- **Secure login** with password input hidden (if preferred)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- MySQL installed and running on your system
- `mysql-connector-python` library installed to interact with MySQL from Python

### Install MySQL Connector

Run the following command to install the `mysql-connector-python` package:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### MySQL Setup

Make sure you have MySQL installed on your system and have a running MySQL server. You can install MySQL from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

### Project Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-editor-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sql-editor-python
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python sql_editor.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Login**: When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the MySQL username and password.
2. **Database Selection**: After successful login, the existing databases are displayed, and you can select one for further operations.
3. **Task Selection**: The editor presents a list of SQL tasks that can be performed such as creating tables, inserting data, updating, deleting, etc.
4. **Custom Queries**: You can also execute custom SQL queries directly via the "Run a custom SQL query" option.
5. **Exit**: To exit the SQL Editor, select the Exit option from the menu.

### Menu Options

- **Show Tables**: Display all tables within the selected database.
- **Create Table**: Create a new table by providing column definitions.
- **Insert Data**: Insert data into an existing table by specifying column names and values.
- **Update Data**: Update records in a table using the `SET` clause.
- **Delete Data**: Remove specific records from a table based on conditions.
- **Drop Table**: Permanently delete a table from the database.
- **Select Data**: Perform `SELECT` queries with optional conditions.
- **Group By Queries**: Run `GROUP BY` queries to group records.
- **Join Tables**: Perform JOIN queries to combine rows from two or more tables.
- **Run Custom SQL Queries**: Execute any valid SQL command directly from the command line.
- **Exit**: Exit the SQL editor safely.
